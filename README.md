# Keylogger-Python
A Keylogger I made because of boredom and pure curiosity. This is for "Educational Purposes" only and not meant for illegal use

# Instructions on How to Use
- Either clone this repository using ```git clone``` or copy the source code.
- If you want to it to send directly to your email, change the s.login("EMAIL_ID_USER") with you email and s.login("EMAIL_ID_PASSWORD") with your app password.
- Just run this keylogger and it will automatically create a txt file to store the keylogs

# Errors
If you happen to run across this error: 
```
smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError: (534, b'5.7.9 Application-specific password required:
```
